# TideTreasures: Stake, Earn, Prosper

## Introduction

DyneDollar, an innovative algorithmic stablecoin inspired by Ampleforth, aims to maintain a market price close to $1 by implementing a unique rebasing mechanism. With the goal of creating a thriving ecosystem, DyneDollar introduces the **TideTreasures** program, designed to reward liquidity providers and encourage long-term support.

## TideTreasures: Rewarding Liquidity Providers

TideTreasures is a powerful incentivization mechanism that allows liquidity providers to stake their Uniswap V3 LP tokens and earn rewards in the form of DyneDollar (DYNE) tokens. By participating in this program, liquidity providers not only support the stability of DyneDollar but also gain the potential for significant returns on their investment.

## How It Works?

TideTreasures is all about staking your LP tokens and reaping lucrative rewards in the form of DyneDollar tokens. The amount of rewards you can earn depends on two main factors - *the quantity of your stake* and *the duration of your staking*.

You stake your LP tokens in the TideTreasures contract, and the contract starts generating rewards in the form of DyneDollar tokens over time. The longer you keep your tokens staked, the higher your rewards become, thanks to a **bonus multiplier** mechanism that increases your reward rate the longer you've staked, up to a certain limit.

Unstaking and claiming your rewards is a breeze and can be done at any time. But remember, unstaking before the bonus period is over means you will not receive the full bonus.

### Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
The exact APY you can earn by staking in TideTreasures can vary depending on several factors, including the total amount of staked tokens in the pool and the duration of your staking period.

In general, the longer you stake, the higher your APY can be, thanks to the bonus multiplier. This is designed to incentivize users to stake their tokens for longer periods, thereby providing more stability to the liquidity pool.

Please use the APY calculator available on our website to get an estimate of your potential earnings based on your intended staking amount and duration.

For example, if you stake 1000 LP tokens for 30 days, you might earn an APY of around 15%. This means you could potentially earn approximately 12.5 DyneDollar tokens as rewards (excluding the bonus multiplier). Remember, the reward may vary based on the total staked tokens in the pool and the duration of your staking period.

### Benefits of Staking LPs in TideTreasures

1. **Attractive APY**: The TideTreasures program offers competitive APYs, providing a lucrative opportunity for liquidity providers to earn passive income in the form of DYNE tokens.

2. **Rewards Amplification**: The longer you stake your LP tokens, the more rewards you can earn. TideTreasures uses a multiplier system that increases your reward share based on the duration of your staking, making it more advantageous for long-term supporters.

3. **Supporting DyneDollar**: By providing liquidity and participating in the TideTreasures program, you contribute to the overall stability and success of the DyneDollar ecosystem.

4. **Transparency and Security**: The DyneDollar smart contracts have been carefully designed and implemented to ensure the highest levels of security and transparency for all participants.
